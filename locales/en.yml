    It is fairly easy to contact me and generally I respond fast, but sometimes, I can be too busy to answer, so, before you try to contact me, keep in mind that it may take 1 to 3 days to get a respond.

    are the <i>fastest</i> way.
contact_emails_text: >
    My primary e-mail address is i@batu.me but sometimes e-mail clients are finding it short and may think it's not real, if that happens, you can use batuhanicoz@gmail.com, which is slower, but works.
    Also, if you're comfortable with Facebook Messages, you can always use batuhanicoz@facebook.com but if your e-mail ends up in Other section, sorry, I'm checking it once 1 week.

    My primary cell phone number is +90 (538) 878 10 16 (Vodafone TR) and I'm a WhatsApp and blip.me user so you can use those applications to contact me.

    just a simple form, names and e-mails are not required. also, this is the recommend way for death treats. (have some death treats? formspring is more anon. but this is faster, your choice.)
