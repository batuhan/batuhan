	Hi, my name is Fırat Batuhan İçöz.

	I’m a 17-year-old Turkish web developer, amateur entrepreneur, and high school junior.

	As of August 1, I'm working as a web developer for an interactive media agency called <a href="http://16pixel.com">16pixel</a>[tr].

	I'm studying on English language and English Literature at <a href="http://bursacumhuriyetlisesi.k12.tr/">Bursa Cumhuriyet Lisesi</a>[tr].
	<h1>WARNING: THIS PAGE IS A DRAFT AND CAN'T BE USED AS REFERENCE.</h1>
	There some many things I can mention about me and I want to mention all of them. Dunno how, why or where to start though.

	In sidebar, you can find my current job information, my full name, date of birth, links to my social accounts, <a href="http://twitter.com/batuhanicoz">my latest tweets</a>, my latest check-in's, my whereabouts and much more like those.

	I think I can list some stuff here. I'll do that.

	<strong>Some silly information about my past:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>I was born on July 21, 1995 at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=967334580752084145&amp;q=KONUR+CERRAH%C4%B0+TIP+MERKEZ%C4%B0,+Osmangazi,+Z%C3%BCbeyde+Han%C4%B1m+Caddesi,+Bursa,+Turkey&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=0CCcQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2I4-Tuv8BM-C_QaiqsH5DA&amp;sig2=FOmedKlpY6sdmDTEMqFUCw">Bursa Konur Hospital</a>, Bursa, Turkey.</li>
		<li>I didn't have any real friends until I was like 12, so I grew as an asocial human being.</li>
		<li>I don't actually remember the model of my first computer but I remember it run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">DOS</a>. (which is stupid, given that we are talking about 8-9 years ago and back then people already were using graphical interfaces.)</li>
		<li>I've opened my first website when I was 12. (no, when I mentioned I've had my first real friends when I was 12, I didn't mean from Internet, I was talking about IRL friends)</li>
		<li>First lesson I've ever failed, ironically, was English. (a year from that, I've become getting 100/100 points from exams, became top of my class.)</li>
		<li>I was raised as a free soul. My parents (by parents I mean my mom) always told me that I can say no, I'm free and can choose anything. She is a wise women.</li>
		<li>My parents (both of them) never kept anything from me. I always knew when our company was not making enough profit, or when we had debts. May seem like bad thing a child to know, but it's not. I knew exactly when is good to ask for new stuff, and when not.</li>
		<li>My first laptop was a second-hand Toshiba, my first brand-new laptop was an HP. Both running Windows XP.</li>
		<li>My first Mac was an <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac">iMac</a>, and I've only paid it 600TL. (400 USD, or something like that.) (now, this one is a long story, you can read it in Turkish, click here.)</li>
		<li>I didn't enjoy my first time. WORST. EVER.  (yes, I'm talking about the first time I've ever had sex.) (guess what, wasn't entirely my fault!)</li>
	</ul>
	I love 4 things more than anything, first is, well, guess what, it's sex. Other than that, reading books. I know, I know, what a cliché... But, I do, and can explain why. When I'm watching a movie, I'm limited. I'm limited to effect team's budget, I'm limited to directors imagination etc. But when I read, I'm only limited to my imagination and, that's my friend, is good as endless.

	Third thing I love is watching TV series. I love them more than movies (less than books). And I think that's because I like their continuity. I've got couple favorites, first one is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a>. THE BEST FREAKING SHOW EVER TELEVISED. Here is a list of the shows I recommend you to watch: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood">Torchwood</a>, True Blood, X-Files, Chuck, Arrested Development, The IT Crowd, House M.D., The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, Stargate (especially SG-1), Supernatural, Skins UK, Misfits, Suits, White Collar, Being Human, Lie to me, Primeval. (I've watched literally more than hundred shows, can't remember all, some doesn't worth remembering though.)
	<blockquote>Related information(s):
	<ul>
		<li>Two of my favorite torrent sites are <a href="http://www.torrentkit.com">TorrentKit</a> and <a href="http://thepiratebay.org">Pirate Bay</a>.</li>
		<li>I'm using addic7ed.com for subtitles.</li>
		<li>I'm using MPlayer X, Movist or VLC Player for watching media.</li>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>
	Fourth thing is programming. For now, I love programming (therefore I love my job). But I think, sometime in the future, I'll bored to do anything I've already done several times with several different languages. I've started to use <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> and used it ever since. In time I've learned <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> and FUEL Framework. In 2011, I've started to learn two other (and their most popular web frameworks) languages, Python (and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django framework</a>), Ruby (and Rails framework). Time will come and I'll choose one and be expert of it, until then, I'm exploring languages (and their frameworks) other than PHP.

When people asks what they are I just call them it's sun allergy and they buy it! I don't have any more diseases, I mean, hope not.</span></h1>
	Since we started on my medical background, I think I can also mention here that sometimes I'm having sleep paralysis.
